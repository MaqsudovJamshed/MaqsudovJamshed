## About me

Hey there! 👋  

I’m Jamshed Maqsudov, a passionate and driven Data Analyst 📊 with a knack for **problem-solving**🛠️ and a deep **curiosity**🧐 for the world of **data**📊 and **technology**🤖. With a background in International Relations 🌍, I transitioned into the exciting world of data analytics through the [Le Wagon Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/data-analytics-course) <img src="le_lewagon_logo.png" alt="Le Wagon Logo" width="25"> 🎓.

Currently, I’m focused on applying my skills in **SQL**🧑‍💻, **Python**🐍, and **data visualization**📈 tools like **Tableau** and **Power BI** to analyze trends and help businesses make data-driven decisions. I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights and love discovering patterns that can unlock growth opportunities.

**Continuous Learning** 🌱:
- 📘 **Expanding Skills:** Advanced SQL techniques, Python libraries like pandas and seaborn, and data visualization best practices
- 🛠️ **Current Goal:** Building end-to-end projects that combine data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to showcase business insights

In my free time, I enjoy a **good workout** 💪, solving **Sudoku puzzles** 🧩, or **playing guitar** 🎸. I’m always up for new challenges and opportunities to learn, and I’m excited about the future of data analytics and its potential to transform industries.
