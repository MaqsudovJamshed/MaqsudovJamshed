👋 Hi, I’m Jamshed!  

I’m a **Junior Data Analyst** curious about exploring raw datasets and uncovering meaningful insights that help explain patterns and support decision-making.  

With a background in **International Relations 🌍**, I transitioned into data analytics through the **Le Wagon Data Analytics Bootcamp 🎓**, an intensive two-month program where I gained hands-on experience with Python, SQL, and data visualization.  

I currently work as a bartender while building my portfolio, dedicating time each day to projects, expanding my skills, and preparing for a junior data analyst role.
